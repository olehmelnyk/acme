# Disaster Recovery Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines our disaster recovery architecture, designed to ensure business continuity and minimize data loss in case of system failures or catastrophic events.

## Components

### Recovery Systems

    C --> D[Validation]
    D --> E[Failback]
```

### Key Components
1. Backup Systems
   - Data backups
   - System snapshots
   - Configuration backups
   - State replication

2. Recovery Processes
   - Failover procedures
   - Data restoration
   - Service recovery
   - Network reconfiguration

3. Validation Systems
   - Health checks
   - Data integrity
   - Service verification
   - Performance validation

## Interactions

### Recovery Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant PS as Primary System
    participant BS as Backup System
    participant RP as Recovery Process
    participant V as Validation
    participant F as Failback

    PS->>BS: Continuous replication
    Note over PS,BS: Disaster occurs
    BS->>RP: Initiate recovery
    RP->>V: Verify recovery
    V->>F: Confirm success
```

## Implementation Details

### Recovery Configuration
```typescript
interface RecoveryConfig {
  rpo: number; // Recovery Point Objective in minutes
  rto: number; // Recovery Time Objective in minutes
  priority: 'critical' | 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
  dependencies: string[];
  validation: ValidationStep[];
}

interface ValidationStep {
  name: string;
  checks: HealthCheck[];
  threshold: number;
  timeout: number;
}
```

### Backup Strategy
```typescript
interface BackupStrategy {
  type: 'full' | 'incremental' | 'differential';
  schedule: CronExpression;
  retention: RetentionPolicy;
  encryption: EncryptionConfig;
}
```

### Recovery Procedures
- System recovery steps
- Data restoration process
- Network recovery
- Service restoration
- Validation checks
