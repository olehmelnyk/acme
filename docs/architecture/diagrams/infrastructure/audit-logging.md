# Audit Logging Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines our audit logging architecture, designed to track and monitor system activities for security, compliance, and operational purposes.

## Components

### Audit Stack

    A[Event Collection] --> B[Processing]
    B --> C[Storage]
    C --> D[Analysis]
    D --> E[Reporting]
```

### Key Components
1. Event Collection
   - System events
   - User activities
   - Security events
   - Application logs

2. Processing Engine
   - Event filtering
   - Enrichment
   - Normalization
   - Correlation

3. Storage System
   - Log storage
   - Retention management
   - Archival
   - Recovery

4. Analysis Tools
   - Log analysis
   - Pattern detection
   - Anomaly detection
   - Compliance checking

## Interactions

### Audit Flow
```mermaid

    participant S as Source
    participant C as Collector
    participant P as Processor
    participant St as Storage
    
    S->>C: Generate event
    C->>P: Collect event
    P->>P: Process event
    P->>St: Store event
```

## Implementation Details

### Audit Configuration
```typescript
interface AuditConfig {
  sources: AuditSource[];
  processing: ProcessingConfig;
  storage: StorageConfig;
  retention: RetentionPolicy;
}

interface AuditSource {
  type: SourceType;
  events: EventType[];
  filters: Filter[];
  format: LogFormat;
}
```

### Processing Rules
```typescript
interface ProcessingRule {
  type: RuleType;
  condition: Condition;
  action: Action;
  priority: number;
}
```

### Audit Standards
- Event categories
- Log formats
- Retention periods
- Access controls
- Analysis requirements
