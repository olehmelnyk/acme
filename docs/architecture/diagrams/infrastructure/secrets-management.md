# Secrets Management Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines our secrets management infrastructure using HashiCorp Vault and related security patterns. The architecture provides a secure, scalable, and automated approach to managing sensitive information across our infrastructure while ensuring compliance with security standards and best practices.

## Components

Our secrets management architecture consists of four main component groups:

### Vault Infrastructure
- Core Components (Vault Server, Storage Backend, HSM)
- High Availability Setup (Primary/Secondary nodes)
- Authentication Methods

### Secret Types
- Static Secrets (Key-Value, PKI/Certificates, SSH Keys)
- Dynamic Secrets (Database Credentials, Cloud Credentials)
- Encryption Services (Transit Encryption, Key Rotation)

### Access Control
- Policy Management (ACL, RBAC)
- Audit Systems
- Compliance Controls

### Integration Points
- Application Integration (Kubernetes, CI/CD)
- DevOps Tools
- Security Operations

## Interactions

The secrets management system operates through the following interaction patterns:

1. **Authentication Flow**
   - Client authenticates with Vault
   - Token is issued based on policies
   - Token is used for subsequent requests
   - Regular token rotation and renewal

2. **Secret Access Flow**
   - Request validation
   - Policy evaluation
   - Secret retrieval/generation
   - Audit log creation

3. **Management Flow**
   - Secret rotation
   - Policy updates
   - Backup and recovery
   - Compliance reporting

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant A as Auth Method
    participant V as Vault
    participant S as Storage

    C->>A: Authenticate
    A->>V: Validate
    V->>V: Generate Token
    V-->>C: Return Token
    C->>V: Request Secret
    V->>S: Retrieve
    S-->>V: Return
    V-->>C: Deliver Secret
```

path "secret/data/{{identity.entity.name}}/*" {
  capabilities = ["create", "read", "update", "delete"]
}

# Kubernetes Auth
path "auth/kubernetes/login" {
  capabilities = ["create", "read"]
}
```

#### DevOps Integration
```yaml
# Vault Agent Config
auto_auth {
  method "kubernetes" {
    mount_path = "auth/kubernetes"
    config = {
      role = "app-role"
    }
  }
}
```
