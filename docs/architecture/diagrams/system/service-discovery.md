# Service Discovery Architecture

## Overview

The Service Discovery Architecture provides a robust and scalable solution for service registration, health monitoring, and load balancing in our distributed system. This architecture enables automatic service registration, real-time health monitoring, and intelligent load distribution across multiple service instances.

Key Features:
- Automatic service registration
- Real-time health monitoring
- Dynamic load balancing
- Failover management
- Service metadata management

Benefits:
- High availability
- Automatic scaling
- Reduced downtime
- Simplified deployment
- Enhanced reliability

## Interactions

The service discovery system follows these key workflows:

1. Service Registration Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Service
    participant Registry
    participant Health
    participant LoadBalancer
    
    Service->>Registry: Register Service
    Registry->>Health: Initialize Health Check
    Registry->>LoadBalancer: Update Service List
    LoadBalancer-->>Service: Ready for Traffic
```

2. Health Check Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Health
    participant Service
    participant Registry
    participant LoadBalancer
    
    Health->>Service: Check Health
    alt is healthy
        Service-->>Health: Healthy Status
        Health->>Registry: Update Status
    else is unhealthy
        Service-->>Health: Unhealthy Status
        Health->>Registry: Mark Unhealthy
        Registry->>LoadBalancer: Remove Service
    end
```

3. Service Discovery Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Registry
    participant LoadBalancer
    participant Service
    
    Client->>Registry: Discover Service
    Registry->>LoadBalancer: Get Available Instance
    LoadBalancer->>Service: Route Request
    Service-->>Client: Handle Request
```

This diagram illustrates our service discovery architecture, including service registry, health checking, and load balancing components.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Registry"
        SD[Service Registry]
        Health[Health Checker]
    end

    subgraph "Services"
        S1[Service 1]
        S2[Service 2]
        S3[Service 3]
    end

    subgraph "Load Balancers"
        LB1[LB 1]
        LB2[LB 2]
    end

    S1 --> SD
    S2 --> SD
    S3 --> SD

    Health --> S1
    Health --> S2
    Health --> S3

    SD --> LB1
    SD --> LB2
```

## Components

### Service Registry

- Maintains service inventory
- Handles service registration
- Provides service discovery
- Updates load balancers

### Health Checker

- Monitors service health
- Performs periodic checks
- Reports service status
- Triggers failover

### Load Balancers

- Distribute traffic
- Handle failover
- Maintain service lists
- Update routing tables

## Implementation Details

### Service Registration

- Automatic registration
- Health check endpoints
- Metadata management
- Version tracking

### Health Monitoring

- Regular health checks
- Custom health metrics
- Failure detection
- Recovery monitoring

### Load Balancing

- Round-robin distribution
- Health-aware routing
- Automatic failover
- Load distribution
