# Architecture Standards

## Overview

This document outlines the architectural standards and best practices that should be followed across all components and systems in our project.

## Documentation Standards

### File Structure
- Every architecture document should follow the standard template
- Documents should be organized by domain (system, infrastructure, security, etc.)
- Use relative paths for cross-document references

### Content Guidelines
- Start with a clear overview section
- Include component diagrams using Mermaid
- Document interactions and data flows
- Provide implementation details with TypeScript examples
- Include error handling strategies
- Document performance considerations

### Diagram Standards
- Use Mermaid for all diagrams
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Include clear labels and descriptions
- Document diagram relationships

## Code Standards

### TypeScript
- Use strict type checking
- Document interfaces and types
- Follow functional programming principles where applicable
- Implement proper error handling

### Testing
- Include unit tests for core functionality
- Document test scenarios
- Follow TDD practices where applicable

## Security Standards

### Authentication & Authorization
- Document security patterns
- Include access control matrices
- Define security boundaries

### Data Protection
- Document encryption standards
- Define data classification
- Outline compliance requirements

## Performance Standards

### Optimization
- Document performance targets
- Include monitoring strategies
- Define scaling approaches

### Resource Management
- Document resource limits
- Include capacity planning
- Define caching strategies

## Integration Standards

### API Design
- Follow REST/GraphQL best practices
- Document API versioning
- Include rate limiting strategies

### Event Handling
- Document event patterns
- Define retry strategies
- Include failure handling

## Monitoring Standards

### Observability
- Define logging standards
- Include metrics collection
- Document tracing approach

### Alerting
- Document alert thresholds
- Define incident response
- Include escalation paths
