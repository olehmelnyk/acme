# Event Sourcing Architecture

## Overview

The Event Sourcing Architecture provides a robust system for capturing, storing, and processing all state changes as a sequence of events. This architecture implements event-driven patterns to maintain a complete history of all domain changes while enabling powerful querying and auditing capabilities.

Key Features:
- Event-driven state management
- Complete audit history
- Temporal querying
- Event replay capability
- State reconstruction

Benefits:
- Data consistency
- Audit compliance
- System debugging
- Time travel queries
- Event replay

## Interactions

The event sourcing system follows these key workflows:

1. Command Processing Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Command
    participant Domain
    participant EventStore
    
    Client->>Command: Submit Command
    Command->>Domain: Validate Command
    Domain->>EventStore: Generate Events
    EventStore->>Domain: Store Events
    Domain-->>Client: Command Result
```

2. Event Processing Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant EventStore
    participant Processor
    participant Handler
    participant ReadModel
    
    EventStore->>Processor: Publish Event
    Processor->>Handler: Route Event
    Handler->>ReadModel: Update State
    ReadModel-->>Handler: Confirm Update
```

3. State Reconstruction Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant EventStore
    participant Snapshot
    participant State
    
    Client->>EventStore: Request State
    EventStore->>Snapshot: Load Snapshot
    EventStore->>State: Apply Events
    State-->>Client: Current State
```

# Event Sourcing Diagram

This diagram illustrates our event sourcing architecture, including command handling, event processing, and read model updates.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Commands"
        C[Command] --> CH[Command Handler]
        CH --> ES[Event Store]
    end

    subgraph "Events"
        ES --> EP[Event Processor]
        EP --> EH1[Event Handler 1]
        EP --> EH2[Event Handler 2]
        EP --> EH3[Event Handler 3]
    end

    subgraph "Read Models"
        EH1 --> RM1[User Read Model]
        EH2 --> RM2[Order Read Model]
        EH3 --> RM3[Analytics Model]
    end
```
