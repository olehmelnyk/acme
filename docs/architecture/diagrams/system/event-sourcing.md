# Event Sourcing Architecture

This diagram illustrates our event sourcing architecture, including command handling, event processing, and read model updates.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Commands"
        C[Command] --> CH[Command Handler]
        CH --> ES[Event Store]
    end

    subgraph "Events"
        ES --> EP[Event Processor]
        EP --> EH1[Event Handler 1]
        EP --> EH2[Event Handler 2]
        EP --> EH3[Event Handler 3]
    end

    subgraph "Read Models"
        EH1 --> RM1[User Read Model]
        EH2 --> RM2[Order Read Model]
        EH3 --> RM3[Analytics Model]
    end
```

## Components

### Command Handling

- Command validation
- Business logic execution
- Event generation
- Consistency checks

### Event Store

- Event persistence
- Event versioning
- Event replay
- Snapshot management

### Event Processing

- Event distribution
- Event handlers
- Parallel processing
- Error handling

### Read Models

- Materialized views
- Query optimization
- Real-time updates
- Cache management

## Implementation Details

### Command Flow

1. Command validation
2. Business rules check
3. Event generation
4. Event persistence

### Event Flow

1. Event publication
2. Handler distribution
3. Read model updates
4. Cache invalidation

### Read Model Updates

1. Event consumption
2. State projection
3. Cache updates
4. Query optimization
