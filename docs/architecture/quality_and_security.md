# Quality and Security Guidelines

This document outlines our quality assurance processes and security practices.

## Quality Assurance

### Code Quality

#### Static Analysis Tools

We use a combination of tools for code quality assurance:

1. **CodeQL**

   - Primary tool for security vulnerability detection
   - Deep semantic analysis
   - Complex code pattern detection
   - Focus on security and correctness

2. **CodeRabbit.ai**
   - AI-powered code review
   - Real-time feedback during PR reviews
   - Best practices and pattern suggestions
   - Maintainability improvements

Note: While SonarQube is a popular choice for code quality analysis, we've decided not to include it in our toolchain for the following reasons:

- Significant overlap with existing tools (CodeQL and CodeRabbit.ai)
- Resource overhead considerations
- Cost efficiency

However, we may consider adding SonarQube in the future if we identify specific needs for:

- Detailed technical debt quantification
- Compliance reporting requirements
- Historical quality metrics tracking
- Team performance analytics

#### Code Review Process

- Static code analysis
- Code review process
- Performance monitoring
- Technical debt management

### Testing Strategy

  - Performance scoring
  - Accessibility checks
  - SEO analysis
  - Best practices validation

Recommended tools for different performance aspects:

- k6 for load testing and API performance
- Autocannon for HTTP benchmarking
- Chrome DevTools Performance panel for runtime analysis

#### Security Testing

Current security testing approach:

- CodeQL for static security analysis
- Trivy for container and dependency scanning
- Gitleaks for secrets detection
- Dependabot for vulnerability monitoring

Recommended additional tools:

- OWASP ZAP for dynamic security testing
- Burp Suite for web application security testing
- SonarQube for security code analysis (if needed)

#### API Testing

Recommended tools:

- Postman/Newman for API testing and documentation
- Swagger/OpenAPI for API specification and testing
- Pactum for contract testing
- Supertest for HTTP assertions

#### Load Testing

Recommended tools based on needs:

- k6 for modern load testing
- Artillery for scalability testing
- Apache JMeter for enterprise-grade load testing
- Autocannon for Node.js HTTP benchmarking

### Documentation Quality

- Documentation standards
- Review process
- Version control
- Accessibility

### Performance Quality

- Performance budgets
- Monitoring tools
- Optimization process
- Benchmarking

## Security Practices

### Application Security

- Authentication
- Authorization
- Data protection
- Input validation

### Infrastructure Security

- Network security
- Cloud security
- Container security
- CI/CD security

### Code Security

- Dependency scanning
- Code scanning
- Secret management
- Security testing

### Compliance

- Data protection
- Privacy compliance
- Security standards
- Regular audits

## Implementation

### Quality Tools

```typescript
// Quality check configuration
module.exports = {
  extends: ['eslint:recommended', 'plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended', 'plugin:react/recommended', 'plugin:jsx-a11y/recommended'],
  plugins: ['@typescript-eslint', 'react', 'jsx-a11y'],
  rules: {
    // Custom rules
  },
};
```

### Security Tools

#### Current Toolset

1. **CodeQL**

   - Primary security analysis tool
   - Deep code analysis for vulnerabilities
   - Custom security rules
   - Data flow analysis

2. **Trivy**

   - Container security scanning
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Infrastructure as Code scanning
   - License compliance checking

3. **Gitleaks**

   - Secrets scanning
   - Credential leakage prevention
   - Git history analysis

4. **Dependabot**
   - Automated dependency updates
   - Security vulnerability alerts
   - Version compatibility checks
   - Automated pull requests for updates
   - Dependency license monitoring

Note: While tools like Snyk, OWASP ZAP, and GitGuardian are popular choices, we achieve comprehensive security coverage through our current toolset:

- Dependency scanning and updates (Dependabot)
- Code security analysis (CodeQL)
- Container and infrastructure scanning (Trivy)
- Secrets detection (Gitleaks)

#### Security Scanning Process

```typescript
// Security middleware configuration
const securityMiddleware = {
  helmet: {
    contentSecurityPolicy: {
      directives: {
        defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
        scriptSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
        styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
        imgSrc: ["'self'", 'data:', 'https:'],
      },
    },
    referrerPolicy: { policy: 'same-origin' },
  },
  rateLimit: {
    windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,
    max: 100,
  },
  cors: {
    origin: process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGINS?.split(','),
    methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS'],
    allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization'],
  },
};
```

## Best Practices

### Quality Best Practices

1. **Code Reviews**

   - Use pull request templates
   - Follow review checklist
   - Provide constructive feedback
   - Document decisions

2. **Testing**

   - Write tests first (TDD)
   - Maintain test coverage
   - Use test fixtures
   - Mock external services

3. **Documentation**
   - Keep docs up-to-date
   - Use clear language
   - Include examples
   - Version documentation

### Security Best Practices

1. **Authentication**

   - Use secure protocols
   - Implement MFA
   - Manage sessions
   - Handle failures

2. **Authorization**

   - Role-based access
   - Principle of least privilege
   - Regular audits
   - Access reviews

3. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data
   - Secure storage
   - Safe transmission
   - Regular backups
