# Architecture Diagrams

This document serves as the central reference for all architecture diagrams in the project. Each diagram follows our [standardized diagram guidelines](../docs/architecture/diagrams/readme.md).

## System Architecture

### Core Architecture

- [System Layers](../docs/architecture/diagrams/system/layers.md) - Core system layering and boundaries
- [API Architecture](../docs/architecture/diagrams/system/api-architecture.md) - REST and GraphQL API design
