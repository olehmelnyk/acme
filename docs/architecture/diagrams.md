# Architecture Diagrams

This document serves as the central reference for all architecture diagrams in the project. Each diagram follows our [standardized diagram guidelines](../readme.md).

## System Architecture

### Core Architecture

* [System Layers](./diagrams/system/layers.md) - Core system layering and boundaries
* [API Architecture](./diagrams/system/api-architecture.md) - REST and GraphQL API design
* [System Workflow](./diagrams/system/workflow.md) - End-to-end system processes
* [Error Handling](./diagrams/system/error-flow.md) - Error handling and recovery patterns

For more information about the system architecture, see [Architecture Overview](./overview.md).

### Data Management

* [Database Sharding](./diagrams/system/sharding.md) - Database scaling strategy
* [Event Sourcing](./diagrams/system/event-sourcing.md) - Event-driven architecture
