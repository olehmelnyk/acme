# Business Logic Layer Documentation

## Overview

The Business Logic Layer (BL) contains the core business rules and logic of the application, independent of the UI and data access concerns.

## Components

### Domain Models
- Business entities
- Value objects
- Aggregates
- Domain events

### Services
- Business operations
- Domain logic
- Workflow management
- Business rules enforcement

### Validation
- Business rule validation
- Input validation
- State validation
- Cross-entity validation

## Structure

## Best Practices

1. **Pure Business Logic**
   - No UI dependencies
   - No direct data access
   - Focus on business rules

2. **Domain-Driven Design**
   - Rich domain models
   - Ubiquitous language
   - Bounded contexts

3. **Validation**
   - Input validation
   - Business rules validation
   - State validation

4. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for business rules
   - Integration tests for workflows
   - Property-based testing

5. **Error Handling**
   - Business errors
   - Validation errors
   - Custom error types

## Implementation Guidelines

1. All business logic should be pure TypeScript
2. Use interfaces for loose coupling
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Write comprehensive tests
5. Document business rules
6. Use proper typing
7. Follow SOLID principles
