# Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures and practices implemented in our project.

## Automated Security Tools

### 1. Dependabot

We use GitHub's Dependabot for automated dependency management:

- Weekly updates scheduled for Monday
- Automatic security patches
- Grouped dependency updates
- Configured reviewers and labels

Configuration: [.github/dependabot.yml](../../.github/dependabot.yml)

### 2. CodeQL Analysis

Continuous code analysis using GitHub's CodeQL:

- Runs on all pull requests
- Weekly scheduled scans
- Extended security queries
- JavaScript/TypeScript analysis

Configuration: [.github/workflows/codeql.yml](../../.github/workflows/codeql.yml)

## Application Security

### 1. Security Headers

Our Next.js application implements comprehensive security headers:

```typescript
// Implementation in apps/web/security/headers.ts
const securityHeaders = [
  {
    key: 'X-DNS-Prefetch-Control',
    value: 'on',
  },
  {
    key: 'Strict-Transport-Security',
    value: 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains',
  },
  // ... other headers
];
```

### 2. Rate Limiting

API protection against abuse:

```typescript
// Implementation in apps/web/security/rate-limit.ts
const rateLimit = {
  window: 60 * 1000, // 1 minute
  max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per window
};
```

## Security Practices

### 1. Dependency Management

- Regular dependency updates via Dependabot
- Security vulnerability monitoring
- Lock file maintenance

### 2. Code Security

- CodeQL static analysis
- Security-focused code reviews
- Automated testing

### 3. Pre-commit Security Checks

We enforce security checks at the pre-commit stage to prevent sensitive information from being committed:

```bash
# Pre-commit checks include:
- Secret detection using secretlint
- API keys and tokens scanning
- Credential pattern matching
- Large file detection (>10MB)
- Protected branch verification
```

### Git Hooks

For information about our Git hooks implementation, see [Git Hooks Guide](../git_hooks.md).

### 4. Infrastructure Security

- HTTPS everywhere
- Secure headers configuration
- Rate limiting
- Error handling without information disclosure

## Reporting Security Issues

For our complete security policy and vulnerability reporting guidelines, see our [Security Policy](../../security.md).
