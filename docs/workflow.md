# Development Workflow

## Work Item Organization

### Epics
- High-level initiatives that span multiple iterations
- Represent significant business value
- Usually broken down into multiple stories
- Examples:
  - User Authentication System
  - Payment Processing Platform
  - Analytics Dashboard

### Stories
- Smaller, implementable pieces of work
- Should be completable within one iteration
- Follow INVEST principles:
  - Independent: Can be developed independently
  - Negotiable: Details can be discussed
  - Valuable: Delivers value to stakeholders
  - Estimable: Can be estimated
  - Small: Fits within an iteration
  - Testable: Has clear acceptance criteria
- Examples:
  - Implement password reset flow
  - Add payment method validation
  - Create user activity report

### Bugs
- Issues found in existing functionality
- Should include:
  - Clear reproduction steps
  - Expected vs actual behavior
  - Environment details
  - Impact assessment
  - Screenshots/logs if applicable
- Lifecycle:
  1. Report
  2. Triage
  3. Reproduce
  4. Fix
  5. Test
  6. Verify

### Tasks
- Internal work items
- Support stories and bugs
- Types:
  - Technical tasks (refactoring, optimization)
  - Documentation tasks
  - Research/investigation
  - DevOps tasks
  - Testing tasks
- Usually not visible to end users
- Focus on technical implementation

## Request Classification and Prioritization

### Request Types
1. **Bugs**
   - **Production Bugs**
     - Critical: Core functionality affected, no workaround
     - High: Core functionality affected, temporary workaround exists
     - Medium: Non-core functionality affected, workaround available
     - Low: Minor/cosmetic issues
   
   - **QA/UAT Bugs**
     - High: Blocks core functionality testing
     - Medium: Testing affected but has workaround
     - Low: Minor testing impact

2. **Features/Stories**
   - **Core Features**
     - Platform Core: Cross-app functionality (auth, notifications)
     - Application Core: Essential app features
     - Integration Core: Critical system integrations
   
   - **Premium Features**
     - High ROI: Direct revenue impact
     - Medium ROI: Indirect revenue impact
     - Strategic: Long-term value
   
   - **Nice-to-have Features**
     - UX Improvements
     - Additional Customization
     - Optional Integrations

3. **Technical Debt**
   - Critical: System stability/security impact

   - Medium: Code maintainability issues
   - Low: Code style and documentation

4. **Tasks**
   - Internal changes (refactoring, documentation)
   - Research spikes
   - Infrastructure improvements
   - Technical investigations
