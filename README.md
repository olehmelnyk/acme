# ACME Project

## Disclaimer

This project was heavily generated by Windsurf AI. I was wondering how far I can go with just AI prompts and trying not to write anything by myself. I started with the prompt - something like "I want to create a monorepo with Nx.dev, I want to use NextJS for FE and BFF, I want to use Vitest and Playwrite for testing, storybook with shadcn/ui, I want to use bun instead of npm or pnpm" - maybe not exact prompt, but close.

Then I realised that new AIs and VS Code forks appears every day or two, and I need a way to share my ideas and vision with other AIs or humans who might be interested in the project or who might be able to help. So I throw into AI some architecture ideas / patterns / tools and best practices and asked to put them into /docs section in .md files - so other AIs or humans might read, understand and follow them. I also asked AI to update docs when I make changes and vice versa - when I manually update .md files - this means we need to update the codebase. So far this strategy works pretty well, and highly effective.

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for the ACME project.
It's a blueprint / playground for a common projects.

It suppose to have some core features, pretty much any project should have:

- auth
- roles:user / customer / admin
- admin dashboard
- user dashboard
- some basic CRUD operations (basic API patterns, search, filtering, sorting, pagination, etc)
- some UI components
- send emails / push notifications
- upload files / images
- messanger (text chat, voice chat, video chat, AI chat, group chat, file sharing, etc)

Might be extended to have more specific features like:

- blog
- forum
- knowledge base / FAQ / support
- social media / networking
- e-commerce / app store / online store / marketplace
- AI / chatbot
- job board / recruiting / freelance
- dating app
- events / calendar
- media (news aggregator, music, radio, podcasts, video, games, etc.)
- web scraping / crawling / scraping
- analytics / monitoring
- SaaS / CRM / ORM
- crowdfunding / venture capital / startup
- internal tools for business operations and automation
- etc.

## Template System

### UI Component Template

The UI component template provides a standardized structure for creating new components:

```
/templates/ui/component
├── [name].tsx           # Component implementation
├── [name].stories.tsx   # Storybook stories
├── [name].spec.tsx      # Component tests
├── README.md            # Component documentation
└── index.ts            # Public exports
```

### Feature Template

The feature template includes everything needed for full feature implementation:

```
/templates/feature/[name]
├── /docs
│   ├── REQUIREMENTS.md  # Customer requirements
│   ├── TECHNICAL.md     # Technical specifications
│   └── TESTING.md       # Testing strategy
├── /design
│   ├── /wireframes     # Low-fidelity designs
│   ├── /mockups        # High-fidelity designs
│   └── /user-flows     # User flow diagrams
├── /src                # Implementation
└── README.md           # Feature overview
```

### Ideas Directory

The ideas directory is organized to capture various types of proposals:

```
/ideas
├── /features          # New feature proposals
│   ├── FEATURE_1.md
│   └── FEATURE_2.md
├── /improvements     # Improvement suggestions
│   ├── IMPROVEMENT_1.md
│   └── IMPROVEMENT_2.md
└── /experiments      # Experimental concepts
    ├── EXPERIMENT_1.md
    └── EXPERIMENT_2.md
```

## Template Usage

We provide CLI tools to scaffold new components and features:

```bash
# Create a new UI component
bun run create:component Button

# Create a new feature
bun run create:feature UserAuthentication

# Generate implementation from idea
bun run implement:idea features/FEATURE_1.md
```

1. Copy the appropriate template
2. Replace placeholders with actual names
3. Prompt for additional information
4. Use AI to help generate initial content
5. Set up the required file structure
