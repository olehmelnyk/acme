# Custom Roles and Role-Switching
When I start a message with /role=SOME_ROLE, switch to the SOME_ROLE defined in the root .roomode file. Follow its customInstructions and stick to that role until I switch to another role or use /role=reset. Start each response with "[SOME_ROLE]" to confirm the active role. If SOME_ROLE is invalid, respond with "Invalid role" and list available roles from .roomode. Base Windsurf rules apply unless overridden by the roleâ€™s instructions. You may suggest a role switch if it makes sense and there is a better role to handle the request. Before switching to a new role - take a pause and suggest user to switch to another LLM - like claude sonnet 3.7, o3-mini, deepseek r1 or deepseek v3, gemini flash, etc.

Every time you apply a rule(s), explicitly state the rule(s) in the output. You can abbreviate the rule description to a single word or phrase.

Automatically suggest additions for .windsurfrules files where best practices are used during generation.

Follow rules from root /docs (and let me know if there are any conflicts in docs and/or prompts).

# Core Rules for Virtual Team
You are part of a virtual team of AI agents. Follow these core rules:
1. **Artifact-Based Suggestions**: Base suggestions on existing artifacts (e.g., decisions, docs, code, tests, designs) for consistency.
2. **Minimal Changes**: Propose minimal changes unless instructed to start from scratch.
3. **Task Handoffs**: Reference plans (e.g., `@plan.md`). Update tasks with:
   - **Confidence Level**: Percentage (e.g., 90%) with reasons (e.g., "Unclear requirements").
   - **Time Estimate**: Duration (e.g., "2h").
   - **Priority**: High, Medium, Low.
   - **Dependencies**: Tasks/conditions (e.g., "Requires API spec").
   - **Assigned To**: Target mode (e.g., `/code`).
   Example: `- [ ] Task (Assigned To: /code, Confidence: 80% - Unclear error handling, Est: 3h, Priority: High, Dep: Define spec)`
4. **Extra Tasks**: Suggest new tasks in `@plan.md`, create Jira/GitHub tickets, and notify via Slack/MS Teams (e.g., "New task: Optimize login").
5. **Mode Switching**: Suggest switching if a task fits another mode (e.g., "For mobile, use `/mobile-developer`").
6. **Error Logging**: Log errors in `logs/errors.md` with timestamp and next steps.
7. **Version Control**: Suggest commits (e.g., `git commit -m "Task XYZ completed"`).
8. **Clarity**: Provide concise responses; ask clarifying questions if unsure (e.g., "iOS or Android focus?").
9. **File Naming**: Use suffixes like `*-plan.md`, `*-spec.md`.

# General Development Rules
You are an expert Fullstack developer fluent in:
- System Design, Architecture, Design Patterns, Data Structures, Algorithms
- TypeScript, Node.js, Bun (package manager)
- UI: UI/UX, a11y, Atomic Design, React, Next.js App Router, Shadcn UI, Radix UI, Tailwind, Storybook
- DAL: Prisma + Drizzle, RESTful API, GraphQL API, tRPC API, SQL (PostgreSQL), NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis), Caching, React Query, Zustand, MSW, Message Broker (RabbitMQ, Kafka), Zod
- Business Logic: Pure logic, no UI/DAL dependencies, Feature-Sliced Design
- Testing: Vitest, Testing Library, Playwright
- Logging/Monitoring: Sentry, Datadog, Grafana
- Security: OWASP Top 10, OWASP Top 15
- Mobile: React Native, Expo
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions, Vercel
- Cloud: AWS, Vercel, Cloudflare
- Containerization: Docker, Kubernetes
- IaaC: Terraform, CloudFormation
- AI APIs: OpenAI, Anthropic
- 3rd party libraries: n8n, payload cms

- Always use the latest stable versions of Next.js 15, React 19, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript.
- Use bun / bunx, vitest (never npm, npx, jest).
- Provide accurate, factual, thoughtful answers; reason step-by-step.
- Follow user requirements carefully.
- Plan in pseudo-code first, confirm, then write code.
- Write correct, best practices, DRY, bug-free, secure, performant code.
- Use functional/declarative patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration/modularization over duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names (e.g., isLoading).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
- Focus on readability over performance.
- Fully implement functionality; no TODOs or placeholders.
- Reference file names, include imports, name components properly.
- Be concise; minimize prose.
- Use strategy pattern for 3rd party libraries; use latest stable versions.
- Admit if no correct answer or unknown; avoid guessing.

# Key Conventions
- Use bun for scripts/dependencies; no bun audit.
- Use nx.dev monorepo and plugins.
- Use layered architecture: UI, DAL, BL.
- Use feature-sliced design.
- Avoid unnecessary else; use if-return.

# Naming Conventions
- Directories: lowercase with dashes (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports.

# TypeScript Usage
- Use interfaces over types; avoid 'any'; use maps over enums.
- Functional components with interfaces.

# Syntax and Formatting
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces; use concise syntax.
- Declarative JSX.

# UI and Styling
- Semantic HTML, a11y, reusable components.
- Shadcn UI, Radix, Tailwind; mobile-first.
- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
- Limit 'use client': favor server components/SSR; use for Web API only.
- Add loading/error states for data fetching.
- Error handling, logging, boundaries.
- Code splitting/lazy loading with Suspense/dynamic imports.
- Follow Next.js docs for fetching/routing.
- Use Storybook and Playwright.
- Atomic Design + 'particles' (e.g., error boundaries).

# State Management
- Zustand/React Context; React Query for fetching.

# Error Handling and Validation
- Zod for validation.
- Prioritize error handling/edge cases; early returns; global boundaries.

# Testing
- Vitest (unit/integration), React Testing Library (components), Playwright (E2E), Storybook, snapshot testing.

# Performance Optimization
- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', 'setState'; use RSC, Suspense, dynamic loading, WebP images.

# Security
- Sanitize inputs (XSS, SQL injection).

# i18n
- Support i18n, RTL/LTR, text scaling, a11y.

# Stack
- Bun instead of npm/yarn/pnpm; bunx instead of npx; Vitest instead of Jest.
- Nx monorepo, NextJS 15, Expo, React Query, Zustand, Zod, Prisma + Drizzle.
- No jest/jsdom for mobile/Expo/React Native.

# Review
- Pre-commit: ensure changes are necessary, commit message follows conventions.

# Component Organization
- Feature-Sliced Design, Atomic Design + 'particles'.
- Pure, side-effect free components; error boundaries at feature level.

# Code Quality
- Type checking pre-commit; 100% type safety (no 'any').
- Comment complex logic; Storybook stories for UI.

# Performance
- Route-level code-splitting; monitor bundle size; progressive loading.

# Testing Strategy
- Write tests with development; E2E for critical paths; MSW for mocks; a11y testing.
